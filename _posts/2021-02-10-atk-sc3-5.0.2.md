## Out Now!!!
* [ATK for SuperCollider](/download/supercollider/) v.5.0.2

---

[ATK Central](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/) is pleased to announce the long
anticipated arrival of the v.5.0.2 release of the
[Ambisonic Toolkit for SuperCollider](/download/supercollider/).

Some notable features of the this release include:

* Integrated support for classic __First Order Ambisonics (FOA)__ and modern __Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA)__.
* Implements the __Near-Field Controlled__, aka __Near-Field Compensated__, form of higher order Ambisonics __(NFC-HOA)__.
* Ambisonic order is merely limited by system speed, channel capacity and numerical precision rather than by design.
* Control and synthesis of the __Near-Field Effect (NFE)__ of finite distance sources in both FOA and HOA, including __radial beamforming__.
* __Soundfield feature sensing & analysis__ in instantaneous and time averaged forms.
* Ambisonic coefficients and matrices are available for inspection and manipulation in the interperter.
* Angular domain __soundfield decomposition and recomposition__.
* Analysis of transformer and decoder matrices.

As always, __A Very Big Thanks__ to the [SuperCollider Development Team](http://supercollider.github.io/contributing/) for all the dedication and hard work!

In particular, the inclusion of access to the [Boost library](https://www.boost.org/)
as part of [SuperCollider 3.10.0](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/tag/Version-3.10.0) has meant we're able to make the underlying numerics of NFC-HOA
available in [_sclang_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#The_SuperCollider_programming_language_(sclang)).

#### A Game Changer? ####

Yeah!

---
##### NFC-HOA Numerics #####

Given access to NFC-HOA numerics, ATK-SC3 is now a _research grade library_. For instance,
the behind the scenes design tasks we do here at [ATK Central](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/) in other scientific computing frameworks (we use [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)),
can now be done in [_sclang_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#The_SuperCollider_programming_language_(sclang)).

Wow!

We've grouped these
[numerics](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html),
into several categories:

* [Component indexing, coefficients, &c](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html#Component%20indexing,%20coefficients,%20&c)
* [Radial filtering spectra & coefficients](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html#Radial%20filtering%20spectra%20&%20coefficients)
* [Radial utilities](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html#Radial%20utilities)
* [Matrix utilities](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html#Matrix%20utilities)
* [Spherical design](http://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Overviews/ABCs-ATK-Coeffs.html#Spherical%20design)

Huh?

Ok, we see we've lost you here.... as a _research grade library_ we're now
able to address tasks like:

* Designing personal binaural decoders within _sclang_
* Designing microphone correction filters within _sclang_
* Upsampling & correcting [FOA RIRs](http://isophonics.org/content/room-impulse-response-data-set) to HOA within _sclang_

So, yeah, we think this is way cool!

(Future releases will include tutorials on these topics.)

##### Soundfield decomposition and recomposition #####

<img src="/assets/images/2021-02-10-atk-sc3-5.0.2/SphericalDesign.png" alt="alt text" title="SphericalDesign" class="img-responsive center-block" style="width: 100%; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em" />

With v.5.0.2 the [ATK for SuperCollider](/download/supercollider/) offers __radial
soundfield decomposition and recomposition__ for NFC-HOA. Know any other toolkit
for artists offering this? (We don't either.)

Here are some things we can do with this feature:

* Specify the radius at which a DAFX operates
* Synthesize a complex HOA soundfield from an FOA soundfield
* Extract, process and re-inject sources found at a given radius

Combine all this with __soundfield feature sensing & analysis__, _the fun never ends!_
