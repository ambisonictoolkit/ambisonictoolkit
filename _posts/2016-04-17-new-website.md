<p class="lead">We are in the process of setting up a new website for Ambisonic Toolkit.</p>

For close to four months we have experienced database problems with the previous CMS, leading to frequent error messages when accessing the web site. In the end we concluded that we might just as well make a fresh start.

<!--more-->

The new website has been set up using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

There are probably still a few wrinkles to iron out, and we'd like to develop the tutorials further, but as a start the downloads are finally available again. If you notice any issues with this site, please add an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/ambisonictoolkit.github.io) in order to let us know.
