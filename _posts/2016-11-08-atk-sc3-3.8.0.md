As you might be suspecting by now, we're _very excited_ about this latest release
of the Ambisonic Toolkit for SuperCollider3 here at
[ATK Central](https://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/). We'd really like to thank the
[SuperCollider Development Team](https://supercollider.github.io/contributing/)
for all the hard work getting this latest release out. __Thanks everyone!__

As you know, the README's
[List of Changes](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#list-of-changes)
summarizes the main new Features, Updates and Fixes. You'll see we've made quite
a few additions and clarifications to the
[Documentation](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/Intro-to-the-ATK.html). The
[SynthDef and NRT examples for ATK](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/ATK-SynthDef-Examples.html)
page is much more verboseâ€”which we expect will be much more helpful. We've
made a very useful improvement for working with kernel encoders and decoders in
[Non-Realtime](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/ATK-SynthDef-Examples.html#ATK%20in%20Non-Realtime).
This was kinda tricky before, as
[OSC message bundles](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/Bundled-Messages.html) had to
be explicitly managed by the user... which wasn't so fun. That's now handled
behind the scenes, all to make NRT Ambisonics _fun again_!

Other _Cool Stuff_? We've added support for reading and writing
[Matrix Files](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/Guide-to-ATK-Matrix-Files.html).
What does that mean? Well... in the longer term, it'll lead to closer
integration with [ATK Reaper](/download/reaper/). We'll be able to design a
custom matrix (Encoder, Transformer, Decoder) in ATK SC3 and then use it in
[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/). It'll also mean we'll be able to author
matrices via external tools, say the
[Ambisonic Decoder Toolbox](https://bitbucket.org/ambidecodertoolbox/adt.git),
for use with the ATK. In the short term, matrix reading and writing improves the
workflow for custom matrix design.

Also, we'd like to reiterate the wide range of supported sample rates:

*  44100
*  48000
*  88200
*  96000
*  176400
*  192000

To get this support you'll need to download and install
[ATK Kernels v.1.2.1](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-kernels/releases/tag/v1.2.1),
if you haven't already. (Of course you already
[knew](/releases/2016/06/17/atk-kernels-1.2.1.html)!)

Do enjoy!
