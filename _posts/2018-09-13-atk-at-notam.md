### Five days of Ambisonics ###

At the invitation of [Notam](http://www.notam02.no/web/?lang=en), [Trond Lossius](http://www.trondlossius.no/pages/bio) and [Joseph Anderson](https://joseph-anderson.org/) (det er meg)
will be leading five days of advanced exploration into the world of Ambisonics and the Ambisonic Toolkit. Day by day, we'll review the following topic areas:

1. Monday: ___Introduction___
  * Soundfield kernel composition: an idiomatic musical composition strategy
  * Ambisonics Theory & Background

2. Tuesday: ___Getting started___
  * Heyser’s Analysis
  * Acquisition Techniques

3. Wednesday: ___Imaging and Processing I___
  * Single Beams & Nulls

4. Thursday: ___Imaging and Processing II___
  * Soundfield decomposition & re-composition

5. Friday: ___In practice___
  * Review: Soundfield kernel composition strategy
  * Soundfield decoding, ‘in practice’


Further details and information regarding registration can be found on the [Notam workshop page](http://notam02.no/web/workshops-for-advanced-users-part-5-ambisonics-with-joseph-anderson-2/?lang=en).

### Composing with Soundfields, ‘think Ambisonic’ ###

> __Soundfield kernel composition:__ An idiomatic composition strategy addressing the holistic problem of creatively controlling a complete soundfield for aesthetic purposes.

Over the workshop we'll explore these topics from the perspective of the soundfield-kernel paradigm. Spatial sound composition becomes of task of soundfield authoring and imaging, rather than one of ‘placing’ a sound in a sound-scene. Attendees will gain insights into soundfield __construction__, __deconstruction__ and __reconstruction__, seeing (and hearing) how soundfields can be __assembled__ and __disassembled__.

Richard Heyser’s __soundfield analysis__ will be reviewed in the context of Ambisonics, offering deeper views into what makes up a soundfield. __Imaging__ and __processing__ will be examined in relation to the __nearfield effect (NFE)__, allowing __imaging ‘within’__ the soundfield. And... combining __analysis__ with __imaging__ and __processing__ will allow us to design __parametric soundfield processing__.

Now that's _spatial composition_!
