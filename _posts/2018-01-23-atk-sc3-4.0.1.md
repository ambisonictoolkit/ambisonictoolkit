## Out Now!!!
* [SuperCollider 3.9](https://supercollider.github.io/releases/2018/01/14/supercollider-3.9.0)
* [ATK for SuperCollider](/download/supercollider/) v.4.0.1

---

The _big news_ here at [ATK Central](https://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/) is the latest release
[SuperCollider 3.9](https://supercollider.github.io/releases/2018/01/14/supercollider-3.9.0).
A __Very Big Thanks__ to the [SuperCollider Development Team](https://supercollider.github.io/contributing/) for all the dedication and
hard work!

Coinciding, is the v.4.0.1 release of the [Ambisonic Toolkit for SuperCollider3](/download/supercollider/), bringing a ___change in the
distribution model___. The ATK's distribution is now refactored to:

* [atk-sc3 Quark](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#atk-sc3-quark)
* [sc3-plugins](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#sc3-plugins)
* [Kernels, Matrices & Recordings](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#kernels-matrices--recordings)

This ___Quark-ification___ of the ATK offers a robust handling of dependencies
and a more responsive development cycle. The README's
[List of Changes](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#list-of-changes)
summarizes the main new Features, Refactoring, Updates and Fixes. You'll see
refactoring includes moving fixed matrices to
[atk-matrices](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-matrices), bringing these
inline with the matrix reading & writing feature added in Version 3.8.0. It also
adds the opportunity to more easily expand the ATK's inbuilt _encoding_ and
_decoding_ options.

#### Any other Cool Stuff? ####

Yeah!

---
##### Soundfield Analysis #####

I'm _very excited_ about the addition of
[Soundfield Analysis](https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Classes/FoaAnalyze.html),
offering a verbose set of features, including:

* High-level Soundfield _Indicators_
* Soundfield _Levels_
* Soundfield _Energies_
* Soundfield _Incidences_ as vectors
* Soundfield _Intensities_ as magnitudes & vectors

What does this mean? The short answer: unprecedented insight into your
soundfield! The __High-level Indicators__ offer details on what _kind_ of
soundfield you've got. __Soundfield Incidences__ let you know _where_ your sound
is "coming from". (If from anywhere?) Given these details,
[transforms](https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Classes/FoaTransform.html)
can be applied to the source soundfield, or spatial cross-synthesis can be
applied to another soundfield. Yeah! We're excited here. Maybe a bit _over
excited_!

##### Soundfield transform display #####

We've added the ability to
[visualize](https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Classes/FoaXformDisplay.html#Understanding%20the%20Transform%20Display),
audition and customize FOA soundfield transforms. This brings
[ATK for SuperCollider](/download/supercollider/)
into alignment with the visualization found in
[ATK for Reaper](/download/reaper/). Additionally,
[custom chains of matrices](https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Classes/FoaXformDisplay.html#Inspecting%20the%20transform%20matrix%20and%20providing%20a%20custom%20matrix)
can now be generated and visualized. This means it is now easy to design
your own spatial filters, and review a visualization of the spatial result.

Yeah, that's _cool_!

##### B-format Audition / Player #####

A nice [little utility](https://depts.washington.edu/dxscdoc/Help/Classes/FoaAudition.html)
offering audition of FOA recordings, panning planewaves, diffuse soundfields,
and transforms.

A picture is worth a thousand words:
